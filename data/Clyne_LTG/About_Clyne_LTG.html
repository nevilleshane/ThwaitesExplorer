Identifying Subglacial Bed Type: A map of subglacial surface bed types has been developed using the high resolution surface feature data collected beneath the ice in the Thwaites Glacier catchment area. 
The subglacial surface is critical to how the overlying ice will respond to a warming climate. 
Areas that are hard are more resistant to the ice, while soft sediments are more 'plastic' in how they respond to the ice flow. The map is interactive so click on the colors. 
Each type of surface will impact the glacier in different ways, click the 'i' button for the information page to learn more about how! EXPLORE TO LEARN MORE!
