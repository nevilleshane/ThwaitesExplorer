New detailed seafloor map near Thwaites: ITGC is focused on collecting high resolution data around Thwaites Glacier, a critical, difficult to access region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Detailed mapping that is critical to move forward our understanding of what is driving the acceleration of glacial change in this remote area. This map is of highly detailed bathymetry (depth below sea level) focused on of the seafloor in front of Thwaites Glacier. Zoom in to examine the shape, depth and highly detailed features that range from narrow underwater canyons to broad troughs, both serving as pathways for  warming ocean water to move up to the ice, accelerating melt. These gouged channels in the seafloor were created by past glacial ice flow, and are used to determine past Antarctic ice speed, thickness and extent.

<figcaption><small> Some of the high resolution mapping was done by Ran, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named after the Norse God of the Sea. Ran is capable of diving below the sea ice and the ice shelves to collect data. This image of Ran shows the AUV emerging from under the ice. Photo credit Lars Boehme</small></figcaption>
