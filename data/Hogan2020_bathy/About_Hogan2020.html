New detailed seafloor map near Thwaites: The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration is focused on collecting high resolution data around Thwaites Glacier, a critical yet 
difficult to access region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Detailed mapping of both the seafloor and the land under the ice is critical to moving forward our understanding 
of what is driving the acceleration of glacial change in this remote area. This map of highly detailed bathymetry (ocean depth measurements) focuses on the seafloor 
just in front of Thwaites Glacier. As you examine the map you can explore the shape, depth and highly detailed surface features that range from narrow underwater 
canyons to broad troughs, both serve as pathways for slightly warming ocean water to move up to, and under, the ice causing accelerated melt. 
These gouged channels in the seafloor were created by past glacial ice flow, and are used to determine past Antarctic ice shape, thickness and extent.
