Detailed bathymetry near Thwaites Glacier: Detailed bathymetry of the Amundsen Sea Embayment, especially near Thwaites Glacier, reveals seafloor features ranging from narrow underwater canyons to broad troughs. Researchers are learning about past ice flow by these glacio-morphological shapes. Some of the hi-rez mapping was done by the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named <i>Ran</i>, capable of maneuvering below sea ice and ice shelves.  LISTEN AND EXPLORE TO LEARN MORE!
