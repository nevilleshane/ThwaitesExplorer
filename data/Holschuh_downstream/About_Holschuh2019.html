Detailed subglacial topography below Thwaites Glacier: Detailed subglacial topography below Thwaites Glacier reveals bedforms features ranging from narrow canyons to broad troughs. Researchers can compare these feature to other deglaciated terrains around the globe (such as Upstate NY) to learn about past ice flow. This UNPRECEDENTED data set was created by using swath radar, leveraging cross-track antennae arrays from survey aircraft (often across the wings).  LISTEN AND EXPLORE TO LEARN MORE!
