New High Resolution Look Under The Ice: Mapping detailed features of the ice-rock interface below the Thwaites Glacier catchment area is critical for building more effective models of how the overlying ice will respond to a warming climate. Both the material and the shape of the bed under the ice affect the speed and direction of future ice flow and retreat. The dataset displayed in this map is highly local, very detailed, and collected over a critical pathway for ice flow. Compare the resolution of this new data to that of the data behind! This UNPRECEDENTED map was created using swath radar, with ‘cross-track antennae arrays’ from survey aircraft (often across the wings). These wide strips of data create an 'under ice' map at a resolution that rivals areas without ice. You will want to zoom in to explore the surface features, from narrow canyons to broad troughs.
