<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
Earth's geologic history has fluctuated between icy glacial periods and warmer temporate interglacial periods for the last 450,000 years.
These cycling warm and cold periods provide us with information on how much and how quickly the Earth has responded to changes in climate in the past.
The <a href="#LGM" data-rel="popup">Last Glacial Maximum</a>, is the most recent cold to warm transition we have and, therefore, is an important geologic marker for scientists
studying how the ice responds to changes in Earth's climate.

<b> Why study the past?</b> Geologists are interested in understanding the Earth, how it formed, how it operates and how it has changed through time. Studying the
past can provide us with important information about historic Earth events like previous climate changes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other disturbances that can help develop
predictions and models for the future. Studying the past begins with the examining the present since understanding current Earth processes helps us to interpret the past.
Sediment, rocks and other markers deposited during Earth events and pathways carved by past rivers and glacial flow, can provide us with information about conditions in the past.
<p>
<b> Why is the Thwaites area important?</b> Thwaites Glacier flows into the Amundsen Sea on the western border of West Antartica. Both the Amundsen Sea and
neighboring Bellingshausen Sea catchment areas are over performing! While these catchments account for only ~25% of the West Antarctic <a href="#icesheet" data-rel="popup">Ice Sheet</a> they account for 33% of the snow accumulation
and currently more than that in <a href="#discharge" data-rel="popup">ice discharge</a>. Their high discharge means that as they continue to lose ice they will have a significant impact on sea level. The amount of water in Thwaites Glacier alone is
65 cm (2 ft) of sea level rise. The wider drainage area would raise the amount to 2 meters (6.5 ft). Data collected on the timing of <a href="#retreat" data-rel="popup">ice retreat</a> since the <a href="#LGM" data-rel="popup">Last Glacial Maximum</a>, suggests that the current
rate of ice loss in this region is faster than that of the past 10,000 years.

<b> How are scientists exploring this topic?</b> Two projects of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaborative are directly focused on
learning more about the past. <b>GHC (Geological History Constraints on the Magnitude of Grounding-Line Retreat in the Thwaites Glacier System)</b>
is looking at evidence of the location of the ice <a href="#grounding" data-rel="popup">grounding line</a> in the Amundsen Bay region. They
will drill through the ice into the bedrock below to collect rocks for <a href="#exposure" data-rel="popup">'surface exposure dating'</a>  to learn when, and for how long, the rock was last uncovered
by the ice sheet. They also plan to collect artifacts like animal bones and other organic material they can collect age dates on, in order to determine the history
of the ice retreat. <b>THOR (Thwaites Offshore Research)</b> will focus on the seabed and sedimentary records offshore of Thwaites Glacier and under Thwaites ice shelf,
to better understand any changes in ocean conditions and glacial response to those changes from the clues left in the ocean floor.

<b> What can we learn from the app?</b> The four lines labeled in the app show the location of the furthest extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
in the Amundsen and Bellinghausen Seas over the last 20,000 years. 20,000 years ago the ice reached as far as the continental shelf, and
then began to retreat until it came to rests at its current position. The lines represents the location of the <a href="#icesheet" data-rel="popup"> ice sheet</a> grounding line at the noted time in ice sheet history.
Grounding lines are an important measure of ice sheet size and critical for determining ice sheet stability.
Each line on the map represents a 5,000 year step. Scientists do not know if during these time steps the ice retreat was steady, or
if abrupt changes occurred, or a mix of both. Take a look at the grounding lines representing 10,000 ago and 5,000 years ago. The data suggests that 10,000 years ago
the ice margin (edge of ice extent) had retreated further than the ice location of 5,000 years ago. Is this something you expected? Why or why not? Note that this means the ice would have
expanded slightly to its location 5,000 years ago. Can you pose a hypothesis for what might have caused this to occur? Do the different grounding lines seem to
change evenly between the different 5000 yr. steps? Does the grounding line location around Thwaites Glacier seem to change at the same rate as the rest of the
line? Can ou pose a hypothesis as to why this might be?

<b> How was this data collected?</b> The data used to create the ice edge locations is pieced together from multiple datasets. For many decades data about the
ocean bottom has been collected from ships in the Amundsen and Bellinghausen Seas using
echo sounding, a process that sends down a sound into the water and measures how long it takes to return to the ship. This can be used to determine ocean depth and
surface features. More recently an improved technique has collected multi-beam swath <a href="#bath" data-rel="popup">bathymetry</a> data. This technique uses a number of sound pulses sent out in a fan
on either side of the ship to get a much more detailed image of the bottom of the ocean.  Additional data included sediment cores from the continental shelf which
were analyzed for different rock material and organics, like marine plankton, to determine the dates they were deposited. Many also contained 'ice rafted debris', bits of rock
and materials moved by the ice and trapped inside, that can only be dropped as the ice moved into the ocean and melted.
