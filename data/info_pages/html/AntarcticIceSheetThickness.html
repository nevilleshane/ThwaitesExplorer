<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
A vast amount of ice is locked up in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. In the unlikely event that it were all to melt,
sea-level would be expected to rise by about 60 meters (200 feet), enough to flood many major coastal cities around the world.
Thwaites glacier alone holds enough ice to add 2/3 of a meter of sea level rise (2 ft.), but its collapse could release more ice behind it, overall adding 3 meters (10 ft.) of sea level rise.
Over the last 30 years, the amount of ice being lost by Thwaites and its neighboring glaciers has doubled. Measurements using radar instruments on airplanes
and satellites enable scientists to  accurately map the <a href="#sheet" data-rel="popup">ice sheet</a>, including its internal structure, and help provide a better understanding of potential future sea level rise.

<b> What is ice thickness?</b> Ice thickness is a measure of the height of the ice excluding the land beneath. Determining what is ice
and what is the underlying land below, is a starting point for developing a measurement for the total volume of ice around the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
Scientists discuss ice thickness and ice changes as 'boundary condition', or a required element, for developing models of how we
expect the ice sheet to behave with changes in climate. This map is in the section of the app focused on changes in sea level. The total amount of
ice and where over time it accumulated, matched to the rate and location of current ice changes are important in understanding
potential future sea level impacts from the ice sheet.
</p>

<p>
<b> What about Antarctic ice cover?</b> The ice cover on Antarctica is both thick and old. The oldest ice sampled in Antarctica contains ice from 2.7 million years ago. It was collected in a region close to the Transantarctic Mountains that separate West and East Antarctica. But there has been ice in Antarctica for much longer.
For ~34 million years Antarctica has been mainly isolated from the rest of the world by the circulation of the Southern Ocean and the air mass of the Polar Front.
Over this period the continent collected snow, pressing it into ice until in the interior regions ice measures more than <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">4000 m</a> in depth.
The land mass is 97% covered with <a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup">27 million km<sup>3</sup></a> of ice, which if fully melted would raise sea level close to <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">60 m</a>.
For glaciers to maintain their size they need as much new snow to be added each year as they lose in melting or <a href="#calving" data-rel="popup">calving</a>. Thwaites glacier is currently shrinking, losing approximately 50 billion tons of ice per year more than it is receiving in new snowfall.
Today it holds enough ice to add 65 cm (2 ft.) of sea level rise, but its collapse could release ice adding an overall 3 meters (10 ft.) of sea level rise. Currently it is
contributing about 4% to global sea level rise but it is vulnerable to significant future ice loss for many reasons. When you finish exploring this map go to the section on "Why is Thwaites vulnerable?" to examine
the maps there, including the deep channels in the <a href="#top" data-rel="popup">topography</a> under the ice and the warming ocean around the glacier.

Although Antarctica is one continent it is made up of two different regions separated into West and East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains. In the app you can
see the separation in the narrowing between the peninsula shape of West Antarctica, and the larger more oval shaped land mass of East Antarctica.
West Antarctica is an ice covered <a href="#arch" data-rel="popup">archipelago</a> with ice measuring up to <a href="#meters" data-rel="popup">2500 m</a> thick.
Were the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to melt the sea level rise contribution would be <a href="#meters1" data-rel="popup">6 m</a>. This is limited by how much of this ice is already
resting in the ocean. East Antarctica, a much older and larger section of land and ice, has ice as thick as <a href="#meters2" data-rel="popup">4100 m</a> in the interior. Although sections
of East Antarctica are also below sea level, there is enough ice stacked on land to raise sea level <a href="#meters3" data-rel="popup">55 m</a>; this is considerably more than any other source on Earth.

<b> How was the data collected?</b> Measurements of ice thickness in this map were collected from a wide range of surveys. The map includes over 25 million individual measurements including high-resolution radarsat data and topographic data
from a number of sources to get full coverage of the area. Ice thickness is a key parameter in computer models that are designed to assess how the ice sheet may change under
warming climatic conditions and how to build predictions of changes in sea level from impacts of melting Antarctic ice. Satellite data combined with airborne data continues to improve our understanding of Antarctic ice thickness, total ice volume and its susceptibility.
</p>

<p>
Data for this map has been collected from the 1940's to present, most of it from 1980 forward and compiled into a single resource called Bedmap 2. A prior version of this dataset was released in 2001,
but between 2001 and 2012 additional data improved our understanding of this continent. Bedmap 2 increased the mean thickness of the ice sheet by 4.6%, lowered the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet
by 72 m, and increased the area of ice sheet grounded below sea level by 10%. The size and remoteness of Antarctica makes data collection challenging but as new data is collected and shared we are improving our understanding of overall
Antarctic ice thickness.

<b> What can we learn from the app?</b> Click around the app to find where the ice is the thickest. How thick is that ice? Looking at the areas of thick and thin ice where are the
thinnest sections of ice found? Find Thwaites glacier in the app and consider why it is so vulnerable to melt.
