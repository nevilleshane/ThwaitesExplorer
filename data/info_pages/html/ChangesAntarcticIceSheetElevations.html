<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Scientists are using a range of methods to monitor the Antarctic Ice Sheet, to tell us how the <a href="#icesheet" data-rel="popup"> ice sheet</a> is 
responding to climate change and assist us in predicting rates of sea level change. Data collected tells us that West Antarctica 
is currently not stable, it is thinning. One of the fastest changing areas of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is Thwaites Glacier bordering the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica.</p>

<p>
<b>Why study Antarctic ice?</b> The ice cover on Antarctica is both old and thick. For some 34 million years, Antarctica has been collecting snow, pressing it into ice until in the interior regions ice measures more than <a href="#meters" data-rel="popup">4000 meters</a>  in depth. 
The continent is the size of the U.S. and Mexico combined and is over 97% ice covered. Antarctica is the largest reservoir of ice on earth, holding enough ice that were it to fully melt, sea level would rise by <a href="#meters1" data-rel="popup">~60 meters</a> . 
</p>
<div data-role="popup" id="icesheet">
<p>A permanent layer of land ice at least 50,000 sq. km. (20,000 sq. miles).</p>
</div>
<p>
<b>What causes changes in the ice?</b> The physical characteristics of the surface of the ice sheet are affected by the ocean, the atmosphere and the compaction of the ice itself. 
Scientists use a quantity known as the surface mass balance (SMB) of the ice sheet to help simplify the complex interactions of the ice, air and water. 
Simply stated the ice sheet's SMB can be described as a balance between the <a href="#snowfall" data-rel="popup">inputs</a> and <a href="#outputs" data-rel="popup">outputs</a> of ice mass. 
Annually adding snow increases the surface elevation of the ice sheet and the overall SMB, while removing snow through sublimation (moving directly from solid to gas state), calving and melting 
will lower both the elevation and the SMB. As <a href="#firn" data-rel="popup">surface</a> snow is buried it becomes compacted and therefore more dense, ultimately reducing surface elevation. 
While ice compaction, through aging of the ice crystals, will change ice sheet elevation it will not overall ice mass.  
</p>

<p>
<b>What about Antarctic ice shelves?</b> <a href="#shelves" data-rel="popup">Ice shelves</a> form around the perimeter of Antarctica (shown in light grey in the app image) where ice flows off the continent. Acting like barricades for the ice sheet behind them, 
they provide back stress to slow ice flow off the continent. 
Their direct contact with the ocean makes them susceptible to melting from a warming ocean. Recently scientists have studied increased melt at the 
base of the Antarctic ice shelves, citing this as a major source of ice loss. This melting weakens the ice shelves and can cause their collapse, 
which allows more ice to flow off the land into the ocean.

<div data-role="popup" id="shelves">
<p>permanent floating sheets of ice that connect to a landmass</p>
</div>
<p>
<b>What about Thwaites Glacier?</b> When an ice sheet is stable it has a fairly constant balance of inputs and outputs. West Antarctica is currently not stable, it is thinning and losing mass. One of the
fastest changing areas of the Antarctic ice sheet is the Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier region along the Amundsen Sea as it borders West Antarctica (the region shown in the image below). 
The combination of <a href="#glacier" data-rel="popup">glaciers</a> shown in red in the image pull ice from deep in the interior, draining a large section of the West Antarctic ice sheet.

<b>How do scientists study it?</b> Scientists monitor the Antarctic ice sheet by measuring changes in ice surface elevation, ice speed, surface melt and overall ice mass. 
Each of these measurements can help tell us how the ice sheet is responding to climate change and assist us in predicting rates of sea level change.

Satellites are used by scientists to measure how the ice sheet is thinning. Researchers track changes in the height of the ice surface relative to some reference surface. 
A primary technique used today is based on sending short laser pulses <a href="#LiDAR" data-rel="popup">LiDAR</a> from either satellites or airplanes. Like radar, LiDAR relies on timing the delay between 
sending and receiving light pulses to the Earth's surface.

Satellites are a primary way of collecting ice elevation data. The European space program has used the CryoSat satellites (I and II)  to collect surface ice imagery (see image). The ICESat I satellite operated until 2009 with an altimeter sending laser pulses with wavelengths at both <a href="#green" data-rel="popup">532 nm</a> and <a href="#infrared" data-rel="popup">1064 nm</a> for surface <a href="#alt" data-rel="popup">altimetry</a> and clouds/aerosols, respectively.  
Pulses were emitted 40 times per second from an altitude of of about <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">600 km</a> above the Earth's surface. Each pulse sequentially lit up patches on the ground, each about <a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup">70 m</a> in diameter separated by about <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">170 m</a>. 
The satellite measured surface elevation change with an accuracy of <a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup">14 cm</a>. 
After the ICESat I program, NASA ran a data collection program called IceBridge using aeroplanes flying over the ice sheet to collect similar data for over a decade. 
In 2018, ICESat II was launched with increased imaging capabilities.

<b>What can we learn from the map?</b> Zoom to Antarctica using the map. The red and yellow colors show areas where the ice surface is lowering. 
These are primarily areas at low elevations near the ice sheet margins and fast flowing glaciers. 
The blue colors show areas where the ice surface height is increasing. This arises from either increases in snowfall or a slow-down in ice speed. 
Notice that there are not many blue areas. The dark grey areas show where there is no or insufficient data. 
Historically the center of Antarctica was poorly covered by satellites so this large area is grey. Newer satellites have added improved coverage. 
The light grey areas around the edges of the continent are the ice shelves (described above).  
The map data in App is representative of the period from 1992-2004 and was compiled by CSIRO, Australia's national science research agency. Zoom out 
on the map to get a view of the full Antarctic continent. Where do you see the largest changes in ice sheet elevation? Do you think Thwaites is an area scientists 
should be studying?
