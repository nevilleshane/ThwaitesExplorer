<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Scientists are using a range of methods to monitor the Antarctic Ice Sheet in order to understand how the <a href="#icesheet" data-rel="popup"> ice sheet</a> is 
responding to climate change. This will assist in predicting rates of future sea level change. The data that has been collected shows West Antarctica is vulnerable 
and undergoing significant thinning. One of the fastest changing areas of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is Thwaites Glacier bordering the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica.</p>

<b>Why study Antarctic ice?</b> The ice cover on Antarctica is both old and thick. For some 34 million years, Antarctica has been collecting snow, pressing it into ice until in the interior regions ice measures more than <a href="#meters" data-rel="popup">4000 meters</a>  in depth. 
The continent is the size of the U.S. and Mexico combined and is over 97% ice covered. Antarctica is the largest reservoir of ice on earth, holding enough ice that were it to fully melt, sea level would rise by <a href="#meters1" data-rel="popup">~60 meters</a> . 
</p>
<div data-role="popup" id="icesheet">
<p>A permanent layer of land ice at least 50,000 sq. km. (20,000 sq. miles).</p>
</div>
<p>
<b>What causes changes in the ice?</b> The physical characteristics of the surface of the ice sheet are affected by the ocean, the atmosphere and the compaction of the ice itself. 
Scientists use a measurement known as the surface mass balance (SMB) of the ice sheet to help simplify the complex interactions of the ice, air and water. 
Simply stated the ice sheet's SMB can be described as a balance between the <a href="#snowfall" data-rel="popup">inputs</a> and <a href="#outputs" data-rel="popup">outputs</a> of ice mass. 
Annually adding snow increases the surface elevation of the ice sheet and the overall SMB, while removing snow through sublimation (moving directly from solid to gas state), calving and melting 
will lower both the elevation and the SMB. As <a href="#firn" data-rel="popup">surface</a> snow is buried it becomes compacted and therefore more dense, ultimately reducing surface elevation. 
While ice compaction, through aging of the ice crystals, will change ice sheet elevation it will not change overall ice mass. Ice sheets are dynamic, however an ice sheet in balance will annually compact surface snow into ice (although a portion will melt or be ablated), 
while simultaneously adding an equivalent amount of new snow. In the map areas in balance show as white, sections nearly in balance are a pale shade of blue or pink.   
</p>

<p>
<b>What about Antarctic ice shelves?</b> <a href="#shelves" data-rel="popup">Ice shelves</a> form around much of the perimeter of Antarctica (shown in light grey in the app image) where ice flows off the land. Acting like barricades for the ice sheet behind them, 
they provide back stress to slow ice flow off the continent. 
Their direct contact with the ocean makes them susceptible to melting from a warming ocean. Recently scientists have studied increased melt at the 
base of the Antarctic ice shelves, citing this as a major source of ice loss. This melting weakens the ice shelves and can cause their collapse, 
which allows more ice to flow off the land into the ocean. For more on this topic see the map called <b>Thwaites ice shelf is melting from below</b>

</div>

<p>

<b>How do scientists study it?</b> Scientists monitoring change in the Antarctic ice sheet measure ice surface elevation, ice speed, surface melt and overall ice mass. 
Although each of these measurements can help tell us how the ice sheet is responding to climate change and assist us in predicting rates of sea level change, the method used to assess 
rates of ice sheet thinning in the app is lidar collected from the NASA Ice, Cloud and land Elevation satellites 2003-2019. ICESat 1 operated 2003-2209 and ICESat 2 operated 2018 to present. 
Between the two satellites NASA ran a data collection program called IceBridge using aeroplanes flying over the ice sheet to collect similar data for over a decade until 2018 when   
ICESat II was launched with increased imaging capabilities.

<p>
<b>How does LIDAR work?</b> The technique involves sending and retrieving short laser pulses or <a href="#LiDAR" data-rel="popup">LiDAR</a> from the satellites. Like radar, LiDAR relies on timing the delay between 
sending and receiving light pulses to the Earth's surface. ICESat 2 carries two lasers (a primary and a back up) sending out 10,000 pulses a second. This is astounding when compared 
to ICESat 1 which operated until 2009, sending out 40 pulses a second! Each ICESat 2 pulse sends out 20 trillion photons but given the vast area only a dozen or so return to the telescope! 
The very fast rate of transmission allows measurements to be collected every <a href="#metric6" data-rel="popup">0.75 m</a> along the ice sheet surface! Computer programs are 
in place to collect the returning photons and calculate the position of the satellite, time traveled, speed of light and ultimately use this to calculate ice surface, 
and to track changes in the height of the ice surface relative to a set reference period.

<p>
<b>What about Thwaites Glacier?</b> When a glacier is stable it has a relatively constant balance of inputs and outputs from snowfall. West Antarctica is currently not stable, it is thinning at rates of up to 5 meters a year, and overall losing mass. One of the
fastest changing areas of the Antarctic ice sheet is the region including Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier where the Amundsen Sea borders West Antarctica (the region shown in the image below). 
In the image, the combination of <a href="#glacier" data-rel="popup">glaciers</a> shown in red pulls ice from deep in the interior, draining a large section of the West Antarctic ice sheet. 
Ice losses measured through through ICESat LIDAR shows 118 billion tonnes of grounded-ice loss per year for all of Antarctica with an incredible 83 billion tons from the Thwaites catchment area. This far excedes every other 
Antarctic catchment area, with Pine Island being the only catchment close at 63 billion tons of loss.
Recall that grounded ice is what contributes to changes in sea level.

<b>What can we learn from the map?</b> In the app zoom out until you can see the full continent of Antarctica. The red and orange colors show areas where the ice surface is lowering. 
These are primarily areas at low elevations near the edges of the ice sheets and fast flowing glaciers. The blue colors show areas where the ice surface height is increasing. 
This can be from either an increase or redistribution in snowfall, or a slow-down in ice speed, you will see that much of Antarctica seems to be colored in blue, especially the largest 
part of the continent, East Antarctica. One are in particular that shows a deep blue is a section just to the West of the Thwaites glacier catchment. 
This deep blue swath is a blocked or stalled ice stream, known as Kamb Ice Stream. Once a fast flowing area of the Antarctic Ice Sheet it slowed considerably a~ 200 years ago.
Historically the center of Antarctica was poorly covered by satellites so this large area is grey. Newer satellites have added improved coverage. 
The light grey areas around the edges of the continent are the ice shelves (described in a section above) and not included in this data map.
