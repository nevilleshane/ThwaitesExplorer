<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ice Mass Loss</i> is the term for an overall reduction in the amount of ice in an <a href="#icesheet" data-rel="popup"> ice sheet</a>. A major tool for measuring ice mass is a set of twin satellites from NASA's GRACE project.
The satellites work together using gravitational attraction to track how water moves between different storage areas on Earth (ice, liquid water, atmosphere). The ice sheets are a major storage of water
and any change in ice mass reduces the attraction between the ice sheet and the satellites, affecting their pattern of rotation as they circulate the Earth.
The Antarctic ice sheet is overall losing ice, mainly on the
West Antarctic coast including Thwaites glacier, and along the peninsula. Loss of ice from the Antarctic ice sheet results in global sea level rise.

<b>Why do we measure ice mass?</b> Antarctica and Greenland are both covered in thick deep ice. Antarctic ice covers almost 97% of its land surface, extending almost 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) and is ~4 kms thick near the center of Antarctica (see the map called <b>Thickness of Antarctic ice</b>).
Greenland’s ice covers over 82% of its land surface and extends about 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles) and is ~ 2 kms thick at its summit (highest point).
The two countries have vast expanses of ice stacked up like mountains on the land. These large ice masses provide a significant gravitational attraction that is detected by satellites orbiting overhead.
Changes in ice mass are directly linked to changes in global sea level. Large ice loss from Antarctica will result in sea level rise around the globe.

<b>How do we measure it?</b> NASA's launched twin satellites as part of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) mission in 2002 to monitor the storage of water on Earth. Any change in the amount of water collected in the ice sheets, oceans, rivers, and even groundwater is able to be measured by
a shift in the gravitational attraction pulling on the satellites. As the satellites orbit they accelerate as they approach a large feature on Earth, and they slow as they move away. Although water and ice have less mass (matter) than the
Earth's interior, but they also change more rapidly than Earth's interior making them trackable by the satellites. Orbiting at a set distance of 220 kilometers apart (137 miles), the two GRACE satellites move closer together or
further apart with the slight changes in mass from a loss of ice. The change in distance between the satellites is not large, just a fraction the diameter of a human hair! This very small shift in their relationship is sensed by the time of
arrival of a stream of microwave pulses that are beamed between the satellites.</p>

<b>What can we learn from the app?</b> Collecting data on something the size of an ice sheet is challenging. Their enormous size, the remoteness of their location and the extreme polar climates combine to make these
areas extremely difficult to measure. Prior to 2002 when the GRACE satellites were put into orbit, data on the loss of ice mass was collected through a combination of different techniques including
loss of ice elevation (see the map called <b>Thickness of Antarctic ice</b>) With the GRACE measurements our accuracy has improved, pointing out that we had previously underestimated ice loss from the ice sheets, and that ice loss is accelerating.
Click through the map layers to see the changes in <a href="#mass" data-rel="popup"> ice mass loss</a> from 2004-2013. The video on this page expands the dates to include data from 2002-2016. The continent of Antarctica has been losing about 118 <a href="#gig" data-rel="popup"> gigatonnes</a>
of ice per year, mostly from West Antarctica and the sensitive area of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers. This loss equates to about one quarter of a millimeter of annual sea level rise from the overall 3 mm global average.
Data from NASA's GRACE satellites has identified mass loss in both ice sheets since the satellites were first put into orbit in March 2002. The video below by NASA steps through the loss of ice in Antarctica.

Antarctica holds enough ice to raise sea level around the world by 60 meters (200 feet) were it all to melt. We have not had an ice free Antarctica for millions of years, but if even a fraction of this
ice were to melt into the oceans many major coastal cities around the world would be flooded. Click on any layer of the map to explore the areas of change in the ice sheet.
Dark regions in the image are experiencing accelerated ice loss while blue areas are seeing ice gain. Ice loss vastly overruns ice gain.
Most of the ice loss has occurred on West Antarctica in the area bordering the Amundsen Sea where Thwaites and Pine Island glacier empty. This region of the ice sheet has been called
the 'weak underbelly' of Antarctica due to its connection far back into the ice sheet, which may allow ice melt to have a 'runaway effect' meaning that once it starts it will continue at high rates.
What year do you think that the Thwaites glacier area suddenly started to show major changes? Do you think that the area of mass loss is getting larger as you click through the years in the app?
Zoom out in the map to see how ice loss is affecting all of Antarctica. Is the ice loss even? Where is the area of most noticeable change?
