<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
This map shows the first high resolution swath radar collected in Antarctica, a technology that allows us to measure the land features under glacial
ice in very high detail. The sensitivity of the overlying ice to changes in the climate, is dependent on <a href="#topo" data-rel="popup">bed topography</a>  
and the bed composition that the ice moves over. Improving our understanding of the bed significantly improves our ability to understand how the ice 
in the area is flowing, and how this will affect the future of Thwaites Glacier. Using the slider on the map the viewer can compare the higher resolution data 
on the surface layer of the map, to the basemap below. The new data reveals significantly more about the shape and features of the land under the ice. 
Be sure to see how this high resolution surface map links to the accompanying map titled <b>Identifying subglacial bed type</b> in this section of the App.

<b>What is this map about?</b> Ice interacts with the bed below, both creating land features as it moves across the landscape, 
and being influenced by the land below in its flow. Our understanding of how different ice processes generate landscape 
features has been developed from studying exposed landscapes around the world many years after any ice has melted away. 
Landforms that were once under the ice have been studied with high precision instruments using techniques such as <a href="#lidar" data-rel="popup">lidar</a> to measure land surface elevation 
and topography and <a href="#multi" data-rel="popup">multibeam</a> swath bathymetry to collect equivalent data on the ocean floor. Models of how the ice interacted with, 
and contributed to the development of the landscape, have been developed from these data. However, new techniques were needed to measure the 
forms hidden under the ice with the same high resolution imagery that would match that of our surface topography. This is now possible using 
swath radar processing. Thwaites Glacier was the first area in Antarctica where this technique was used.

<b>How can we look under the ice?</b> For information on this we refer you back to the information page for the map called <b>A Look Under the Antarctic Ice Sheet</b> in the App. There we 
review how a combination of geophysical tools can be used to image through the ice to better understand the land surface below. 
There we also review some of the many things we can learn from looking under the ice, and broad questions we can answer by interacting with the data. 
The more developed the technology, and the more detailed the data we collect, the more specific the questions that can be asked and answered, 
helping us to push forward our understanding of ice/landscape interactions.

<b>What is swath processing?</b> Conventional techniques for measuring and characterizing the land surface under the ice includes the use of seismic 
and <a href="#nadir" data-rel="popup"> nadir-focused</a> radar. Seismic measurements use small explosions that when detonated send sound reverberations that are then measured to provide 
information on the depth to the bed and on its surface material. Nadir-focused radar measures the timing of the travel of radar waves collected 
directly below the source. Traditionally radar lines are collected at spacing that is kilometers apart, and the areas that fall in between are 'smoothed' to connect the data. 
Swath radar collects data not just directly below but all along a fan shaped strip spreading out on either side from the nadir, 
creating higher resolution, three-dimensional maps of the features below. For the data shown in this map the swaths were ~ 2km wide, and subglacial land 
features were imaged at~ 25 meter resolution, which allowed land features to be retained and identified clearly in the data.

<p>
<b>Why is this high resolution data important, or what can I learn from this map?</b> See for yourself how much more information is available in this new map layer. Use the slider on the bottom of the page 
to ‘pull back’ the overlying layer and look for features to match up between the overlying layer and the layer below. You can also see how much 
more detail is in the new layer. It is amazing to see the differences, like improving our eyeglass prescription! It is this new level of detail that allows us to identify features 
in the landscape beneath the ice that tell us how the ice has created the landscape below. Look for the high areas that block the ice flow as it 
moves across the landscape. Now find the depressions or low areas that form around the high landforms as the ice moves across the landscape. 
Find the deepest area in these newly imaged areas, how deep are they? Think of the power of the ice as it carves across the landscape, scraping across 
and digging out areas of the surface as it goes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>What has this work allowed us to do?</b> This work on Thwaites has shown how the ice has carved over the surface below digging out troughs or moats on the 
sides of more resistant landforms and then dropping a trail of softer sediments behind as it continues to flow. 
Swath radar is improving our understanding of the surface beneath the ice, yet it is not possible to use 
this approach to measure large areas like the vast millions of square 
kilometers of hidden landscape under Antarctic ice. It is, however, extremely beneficial in targeted areas like Thwaites region, where we are seeking very specific 
information on glacier movement and acceleration: (1) in areas along glacier flow to better understand ice/bed interactions; and (2) at the grounding line where the ice detaches from the land below.
