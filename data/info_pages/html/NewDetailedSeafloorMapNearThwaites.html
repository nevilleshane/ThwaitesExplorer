<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Detailed mapping of both the seafloor and the land under the ice is critical to moving forward our understanding of what is driving the acceleration of glacial change in Thwaites Glacier.  
However, the area is extremely challenging to reach, often blocked by sea ice, icebergs and ice shelves thus data has remained scarce. In 2019 an ITGC research cruise was able to collect highly 
detailed <a href="#bath" data-rel="popup">bathymetry</a> data focused on the seafloor just in front of Thwaites Glacier. The data show deep cut channels that provide pathways for warmer ocean water 
to reach up under the ice shelf where it is causing ice melt.<hr>

<b>What is this map about?</b> This map focuses on seafloor bathymetry and understanding its shape and depth in the region just in front of Thwaites Glacier. Understanding the geometry of the ocean floor is critically important for several reasons. 
(1) Trenches and deep channels in the seafloor are pathways the ocean uses to access the ice. Ocean temperatures around Antarctica are an 
important influence on the ice, especially the salty, warmer 0.5 to 1.5 degree C water in the <a href="#CDW" data-rel="popup">Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW)</a>. 
(See the following section, and view the map <b>Ocean Temperatures at 550m</b> in the app to learn more). 
(2) Along with deep trenches, the seafloor has elevated ridges or high points where the ice can attach, providing stability and slowing retreat of the <a href="#GL" data-rel="popup">grounding line</a>. 
Additionally, ridges can reroute and block water that is moving in to erode the grounding line.

</p>

<p>
<b>What is the role of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW)?</b> In the ocean, differences in temperature and salinity create different density layers in the water. 
The top layer of ocean surface water around Antarctica is dominated by cold fresh meltwater from the ice, but layered beneath this <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">300-500 meter</a> 
layer of colder surface water is a mixture of warmer salty water. This <a href="#celcius" data-rel="popup">0.5 to 1.5°C</a> water comes from a water mass called the 
<a href="#CDW" data-rel="popup">Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW)</a> circulating around Antarctica as part of the large 
<a href="#ACC" data-rel="popup">Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)</a>. The <b>CDW</b> plays a critical role in the changes taking place in the Amundsen Sea and Thwaites Glacier region. 
<div data-role="popup" id="ACC">

</div>
<div data-role="popup" id="celcius">

</div>
</p>
<p>
 The warmer <b>CDW</b> moves in from the ocean and is denser due to higher salt content. Scientists worry about pathways in channels or troughs that allow dense <b>CDW</b> to move 
 from the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica across the <a href="#CS" data-rel="popup">continental shelf</a> and up to the and under the ice where its temperature 
 will melt and erode the ice. In most areas around Antarctica the warmer <b>CDW</b> reaches the land below the continental shelf break sitting deep enough in the water column that it does 
 not make it up onto the shelf. However, in the area around Thwaites <b>CDW</b> does move up onto the shelf where any deep cuts in the seafloor provide a pathway to the ice and the 
 grounding line, the leading edge of where the ice remains frozen to the bed.

<p>
<b>How was this data collected?</b> The data was collected using a multibeam echosounder (MBES) an instrument that measures a number of depths along a strip 
(swath) of ocean bottom. Sound is used to obtain the depths. A transducer sends a pulse of sound through the water, the sound reflects off the bottom returning 
back to an array of transducers. MBES operate a single transmitting beam with many receiving beams. For this dataset <a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup">2000 km²</a> of new data was acquired for an 
area <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">40 km</a> out from the ice shelf edge across much of Thwaites Glacier. This was possible due to the limited amount of sea ice that existed in front of Thwaites 
Glacier from January-March 2019.
Note that the final data compiled in this map includes MBES data from several other cruises that have operated in this areas by the US, UK, Germany, Sweden and Korea.

<b>What can you find in the data?</b> A deep depression with water depths of <a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup">1100-1250 meters</a> was identified 
just offshore, and named Thwaites Trough, running NNE-SSW. This was deeper than the seafloor around it by <a href="#metric4" data-rel="popup">200-400 meters</a>. 
166 troughs were analyzed, and resulting measurements showed the troughs are generally 10-30 times wider than deep, with average widths or <a href="#metric5" data-rel="popup">2090m</a>, 
depths or <a href="#metric6" data-rel="popup">90m</a>, and cross sectional area of <a href="#metric7" data-rel="popup">144000m²</a>. Spend time exploring the data, click on the areas that 
are deep to see where you find the deepest measurements. Next explore the data to see if you can find pathways that could carry CDW up to the ice shelf.

<b>Why is this data important?</b> This new data from just offshore of Thwaites Glacier revealed two important and dominant features, a <a href="#metric8" data-rel="popup">~65 km</a> long, <a href="#metric9" data-rel="popup">~1200 m</a> deep trough, and a 
discontinuous ridge at water depths of <a href="#metric10" data-rel="popup">650 to <100m</a>. Both link directly to ocean/ice interactions. The deep trough 
has the capacity to transfer heat and ocean water right up to the grounding line, while higher areas like ridges can block water flow as well as serve as 
a pinning point for ice. The dataset highlights the value of high resolution information, as previously collected regional data 
was unable to capture the variability in the seafloor and had underestimating the depths of the troughs that are carved into the seafloor, 
potential pathways for warm water to reach Thwaites Glacier’s grounding line. Depths were understated by amounts of <a href="#metric11" data-rel="popup">250, 500 and 400 meters</a> (see figure), 
overall underestimating the cross-sectional areas from 7-38%. In addition to underestimating the depths of troughs, the data also underestimated seafloor highs, 
with some areas found to be more than 100m shallower than stated.
