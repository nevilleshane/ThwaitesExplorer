<h4>Summary of Thwaites Ice Shelves are Melting from Below</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Ice shelves are permanent floating sections of the ice sheet that form along the coastline. In Antarctica these thick platforms of ice 
exist where the leading edge of the ice sheet has flowed off the land and into the ocean. Ice shelves circle much of the Antarctic coast, 
pushing back against the massive amount of ice that is flowing from the center of the ice sheet. Floating in the Southern Ocean 
they represent the most vulnerable part of the ice sheet to melting. Research confirms that the shelves are melting from below, yet are not responding uniformly to warming ocean water. </p>

<b>Why study ice shelves?</b> <a href="#shelves" data-rel="popup">Ice shelves</a> form around the perimeter of Antarctica where ice flows off the land. Almost half of the Antarctic coastline is 
protected by ~45 ice shelves, representing almost 10% of Antarctica's total ice cover.  
Ice shelves are thick, <a href="#meters" data-rel="popup">~1000 meters</a> thick where they first go afloat, thinning to <a href="#meters2" data-rel="popup">~100 meters</a> thick at their front. 
Their thick stable structure makes them function like barricades for 
the <a href="#icesheet" data-rel="popup">ice sheet</a> behind them, providing back stress to slow the ice flow as if moves off the continent. 90% of the ice shelf sits below 
the water.

It is this direct contact with the ocean that makes them susceptible to melting from a warming ocean. However, ice shelves can weaken in several ways including: (1) surface melt from a warming 
atmosphere, causing water to pool and weaken the shelf; (2) basal melt from warming ocean water melting the ice from below; (3) <a href="#crevass" data-rel="popup">Crevassing</a> from ice stress 
as the ice accelerates and strains as it flows; and (4) changes in <a href="#seaice" data-rel="popup">sea ice</a> cover may be exposing the ice shelves to more ocean wave activity and warm water exposure, causing 
them to weaken. All four of these processes can work together or independently to weaken the ice shelves, causing all or part of the ice shelves to lose ice and even collapse.

<b>How do ice shelves form?</b> Ice from an ice sheet is stacked thick and is constantly being tugged by gravity, pulling it across the landscape and into the ocean 
in <a href="#glacier" data-rel="popup">glaciers</a> and <a href="#icestream" data-rel="popup">ice streams</a>. 
If the ocean is cold enough the newly floating ice doesn't melt right away, and collects. Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean, 
a body of water that has remained fairly cold, due to its isolated circulation pattern and a lack of sunlight due to the tilt of the Earth. 
It is the cold water around Antarctica that has allowed the ice to stay attached to the continent, growing and expanding as glacial ice continues to flow into the ocean. 
Along some of the protected Antarctic coastlines, ice shelves have hinged against rocky peninsulas and islands allowing them to survive for thousands of years. 
Ice shelves are dynamic, however, constantly shedding icebergs off the front and collecting new ice from behind. This loss and addition of ice has provided a type of dynamic stability. 
However, in the last 25 years we have seen several ice shelves destabilize and completely collapse.

<b>What happens when an ice shelf collapses?</b> Once an ice shelf collapses it releases the ice behind it, allowing more ice to flow off the land into the ocean. 
When an ice shelf collapses, the ice that was behind can accelerate dramatically, sometimes flowing at rates up to five times faster than previously. Perhaps one of the most well known ice shelf collapses 
was that of the Larsen ice shelves. The Larsens were a family of ice shelves, A-D, that were stacked up one beside the other along the northeasterly edge of the West Antarctic 
Peninsula (E-G also exist but are much smaller). As recently as 1997 they covered much of coastline in that region. But ice shelves can behave like dominoes. 
When they are lined up if the first one collapses it can cause a rippling effect, setting off a series of collapses with one falling after the other. To witness the collapse see the Larsen gif below (to replay you will 
need to refresh your browser). Although sections of the ice shelves can 
collapse without triggering a larger impact, scientists have calculated a 'threshold' amount, once past the ice sheet is ultimately unable to provide the buttressing support 
needed to hold back the ice, and often ends in complete collapse.   
</p>

<p>

<b>How was the data collected and what did it tell them?</b> Measuring changes in ice shelf melt can be extremely challenging. To collect the data in the map scientists combined 
radar altimetry data from both IceSat and CryoSat-2 satellites. Changes were averaged over 2010-2018. One of the interesting things that the scientists found was that melt 
was occurring from below, driven by the ocean, but how much and where was very different depending whether the ice shelf was classified as a 'warm-water' or a 'cold-water' ice shelf.

You can use the map shown here to locate the warm-water and cold-water ice shelves. Warm-water ice shelves, tend to have higher overall melt rates, 
and are shown here surrounded by shades of green in the ocean, representing 
waters above <a href="#temp1" data-rel="popup">0°C </a>. They are mainly represented by ice shelves in the Bellinghausen and Amundsen seas, including the Wilkens, George VI, Abbott, Getz, Thwaites, Dotson, Crosson and Pine Island ice shelves. 
All of these ice shelves are melting at meters a year from below! Cold-water ice shelves are shown with large sections of yellow, representing ocean 
water temperatures closer to <a href="#temp1" data-rel="popup">0°C </a> and include Ross, Ronne, Filchner and Amery. These shelves tended to have two zones of higher melt 
rates, under deep ice drafts near the <a href="#grounding" data-rel="popup">grounding line</a> and under shallow ice drafts near the ice front, yet areas of refreezing occurred between 
these two zones.

<b>What can we learn from the map?</b> Using the map in the app zoom out until you can see the full continent of Antarctica. The ice shelves are the only thing colored in the app, and they look very 
small compared to the larger ice shelf. The red and pink colors show areas where the ice shelves are thinning, melting from below. Click around the perimeter to 
see where you can find the largest pockets of thinning or basal melt. Only a few of the very large ice shelves show areas 
of blue meaning they are thickening. Zoom in to the Thwaites area and explore how this region is changing. Where can you find the largest areas of ice sheet thinning? 
What do you think, is Thwaites an area scientists should be studying?
