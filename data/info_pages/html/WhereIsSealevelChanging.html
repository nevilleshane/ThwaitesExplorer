<h4>Summary</h4> 
<p>
Sea-level is affected by many factors and does not change the same way everywhere on Earth. 
Locally-defined sea-level, known as relative sea-level, has the largest impact upon our communities. 
Averaged across the globe, sea-level has risen about 200mm over the past 100 years, but locally in some coastal regions, 
sea-levels can be far from the average, rising faster or in some areas falling. Local vertical land movement plays a big part in 
determining the height of relative sea-level and can result from natural processes such the land rebounding following earlier ice covering, or 
earthquake-induced motion.

<b>What causes sea level to change?</b> Sea level changes through time as a result of a range of Earth processes that can be explored through this app. 
In the past century, the absolute height of average sea-level has risen <b>globally</b> by approximately<a href="#inches" data-rel="popup"> 200 mm</a>. 
Over that time about half of that rise has been due to thermal expansion of the warming ocean water, and the majority of the remainder has come from 
additional discharged into the ocean by melting land glaciers, and in a smaller amount melting from the ice sheets. The Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) 
was established in 1993 to collect, publish, analyze and interpret sea level data from a permanent global network of tide stations. 
Based in Liverpool at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) it relies on member nations to contribute their monthly data. The image shows the GLOSS Core Network of 300 
tide stations around the world allocated for baseline data. These sites are located on islands to maximize exposure to the open ocean. 
Most studies of 20th century global sea level rise are based on the PSMSL data set.

<p>
<b>What is happening with sea level globally?</b> For most of the past century, the change in global sea-level occurred at a pace of about <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">1.7 mm/year</a>. However, 
tide gauge data and satellite measurements show that since the early 1990s sea-level rise has been accelerating, rising at about <a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup">3.2 mm/year</a>, twice as fast as before. These are average values. In some locations, the rise in sea-level 
has been greater than the average rate, while in other areas there has actually been a drop in average 
sea-level over the same time frame. This map from NOAA is of tide gauge measurements showing <i>relative sea-level</i> in each location. On the map 
view (and in the image to the below) you see areas of the Gulf Coast and sections of the Northeastern U.S. that are experiencing a pronounced rise in sea-level. 
In coastal Louisiana, pronounced land subsidence leads to relative sea-level rising at about <a href="#metricLA" data-rel="popup">10 mm/year</a>.  
In contrast, in part of Alaska, the 
strong vertical land uplift due to tectonic motion combines with post-glacial rebound to result in a fall in relative sea-level of as 
much as <a href="#metricAK" data-rel="popup">15 mm/year</a>. These differences can be explained by vertical changes in the shoreline from either <i>subsidence</i> or <i>uplift</i> as explained below.

<b>What is relative sea-level?</b> <i>Relative sea-level</i> refers to the mean height of the ocean at one particular location. 
There are different factors affecting relative sea-level that include ocean density, atmospheric pressure, seasonal 
weather patterns, the movement of sediments, and anthropogenic influences such as dredging and 
the draining of wetlands. However, the major players are the interaction between the warming and thermally-expanding ocean and up and down vertical movements of the land 
surface. In places where the land is <i>subsiding</i> or moving downwards at the same time that absolute 
sea-level is rising, the local, relative rise in sea-level can be dramatic.
Land subsidence is causing faster-than-average rates of sea-level rise around many parts of the eastern and southern shorelines in the U.S. 
Some of the subsidence is driven by natural earth processes, but some is <b>aggravated by human activities</b>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>How can humans affect sea-level?</b> The <a href="#texas" data-rel="popup">Galveston-Houston</a> area 
of Texas and Virginia's Chesapeake Bay region have both been affected by the decades-long removal 
of freshwater from underground aquifers, with the Texas locality also impacted by oil and gas 
extraction. The map below, for Chesapeake Bay, shows that groundwater levels in the aquifer 
have dropped by as much as <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">65 m</a> in the 20th Century. The corresponding reduction in groundwater 
pressure causes the land surface to subside as the sedimentary layers compress.
</p> 
<p>

	<figcaption><small>(Touch Image For Description)</small></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
In these parts of Texas and Virginia, the sinking land and rising ocean water produce 
a local sea-level rise of about <a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup">6 mm/year</a> (Texas) and <a href="#metric4" data-rel="popup">4 mm/year</a> (Virginia). 
But the story in the Chesapeake Bay is complex with natural and human induced contributions involved. 35 million years ago a large meteor 
impacted the bay by Norfolk VA. weakening the sediment in a wide <a href="#metric11" data-rel="popup">80 km</a> stretch. 
This weakening may still be contributing to the land subsidence. In addition, this area is still undergoing <i>glacial isostatic adjustment</i> after the last Glacial Maximum. 
This area sat on the edge of the land that was popped up like the end of a lever by the weight of the ice sheet further north. 
In coastal Louisiana, sea-level is rising even faster, at a rate of <a href="#metric5" data-rel="popup">9-11 mm/year</a> 
which is the fastest rate in the U.S. and one of the fastest rates in the world. 
That high rate results from the combination of global sea-level rise and local, rapid land subsidence 
due to compaction of Mississippi delta sediment and large-scale engineering projects that 
reduce the flow of replenishing sediments that once flooded the area regularly. We saw one effect of this subsidence when in 
2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast and the city of New Orleans. Storm surge measuring <a href="#metric6" data-rel="popup">3-6 m</a> flooded areas further inland, 
causing destruction to the highly settled region.

</div>
<p>
<b>What else causes sea-level to fall?</b> There are some areas of the world where relative sea-level is actually <i>falling</i> because 
the land is moving upwards at a rate faster than absolute global sea-level is rising. There are several causes for this. 
During the last ice age, northern hemisphere ice sheets were centered upon Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada (the Laurentide ice sheet) and 
upon Fennoscandia (the Eurasian ice sheet). Their immense weight pushed down the land beneath, is hard for us to imagine. You can use the interactive that is 
linked in the image to the left that lets you click through time, starting 120,000 years ago in a relatively warm period, through to the most recent ice age and 
the growth of the Laurentide ice sheet, and then up to present. See how the land deforms under the weight of the ice, and the linked 
impacts on global sea level. Additionally, the image below shows how the ice weight pushes down on the land directly below, while the edges (called the peripheral bulge) 
are popped up. It is this combination of processes that directly affects sea level. Together geologists refer to this process as <i>glacial isostatic adjustment</i> and the timing 
of the land response is slow with <i>uplift</i> occurring over thousands of years.

The map of Scandinavia below shows that the rate of uplift is as much as <a href="#metric7" data-rel="popup">10 mm/year</a>. Similar rates are measured for Hudson Bay. 
Areas once popped up on the glacial peripheral bulge are now subsiding as the mantle beneath 
returns to a state of equilibrium. As mentioned in the discussion above on the Chesapeake Bay region, elevations across much of the northeastern U.S. below New York, some Baltic nations and the south of England are subsiding because 
of this glacial rebound effect. This contributes to the rise in relative sea-level, in some 
cases of up to a few millimeters per year.

Regionally, the vertical movement of land can be complicated to understand. 
Parts of southern Alaska that were once depressed beneath the weight of regional glaciers and smaller 
ice sheets are rapidly being uplifted as you can see on the map. At the same time, the complex interaction of the Pacific and North 
American tectonic plates and the smaller Yakutat terrane, a small fragment of crustal material that is attaching itself to the Alaskan coast, is causing additional rapid uplift of the land. 
Here the combined effect of the post-glacial rebound and tectonic forces greatly exceeds the rise in absolute 
sea-level, resulting in the localised relative sea-level dropping very quickly. At rates of <a href="#metric8" data-rel="popup">10-15 mm/year</a>, these are some of the fastest retreats of sea-level on Earth. 
Plate tectonics is also responsible for more drastic changes in relative sea-level. For example, 
the catastrophic magnitude 9 Tohoku earthquake of March 2011 caused a significant area of land in 
eastern Japan to instantaneously drop below sea-level.

<p>
The dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere also play a role. In the Western Pacific Ocean, sea-level 
has been rising at three times the global average since 1993, perhaps due to an 
intensification of the trade winds that piles up ocean water there. In another example,
<a href="#gulf" data-rel="popup"> the mid-Atlantic Drift</a> could produce a rise in sea-level of an extra <a href="#metric9" data-rel="popup">200 mm</a> in New York City. In that scenario, 
warming of the north Atlantic and increased melting of Greenland glaciers could alter the temperature 
and density of the seawater enough to reduce the strength of the Gulf Stream which, at present, sweeps 
ocean water away from the U.S. northeast coastline and into the strong flow. If that flow is reduced, the 
water could move closer to shore. Additionally, some research suggests that the gravitational pull exerted 
by the massive Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets attracts ocean water and effectively lowers sea-level
in other parts of the global ocean. For example, if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was to melt, which would take 
considerable time, the gravitational attraction around West Antarctica itself would weaken and the water that had been attracted 
there would move away resulting in additional sea-level rise in the northern hemisphere. This change could add as much as a meter or two on top of the expected 
~6 m of sea level rise from the melted ice sheet itself.

<b>What can I learn from this map?</b> There is a wealth of information in this map! Spend some time exploring by selecting a dot and clicking on it. 
You will see the location name, length of time the station has been collecting data, and the current rate of sea level change at that tide gauge listed 
in mm/year. You can even explore further by clicking on each station for long-term trends and station specifics. 
There are many areas that will cause you to wonder and question what is happening in that region! We noted several interesting stories here and in the audio 
clip of the app...but there are many more things to learn from exploring this map!
