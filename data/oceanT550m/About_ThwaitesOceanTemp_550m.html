Ocean temperatures at 550m: Ocean temperature is an important factor in glacial ice melt where there is a direct contact. Antarctica is completely surrounded by the Southern Ocean, and Antarctic ice extends not only to the very edge of the land, but beyond, as ice flows off the land and goes afloat along most of the coastline forming ice shelves. This map shows a collection of observed Southern Ocean temperatures collected at a depth of 550m.  Warmer tones like yellows, orange and red are above 0 degrees celcius, and color blue tones remain below freezing.

Caption: Image from ITGC (Holland et al., 2020) demonstrating the effect of warm ocean water on ice shelf size and ability to buttress the ice sheet. A warm water 'cavity' (water filled space under the ice shelf) like Thwaites with a shortened ice shelf, versus a cold water cavity like Ross with a much larger ice shelf.
